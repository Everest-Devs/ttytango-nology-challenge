## How to use this repo and view the project

This method assumes you have node and npm installed on your device. 
It will allow you to view the sass/scss and make changes should you wish to play around with the styling.
Due to the extensive scss files, it will have a longer load time.
Merely opening up the index.html file without running the following scripts will mean that the font-awesome icons will not appear. 



1)
- Clone repository

- Then cd into nology-challenge directory

2)
Run the following commands:
```
$npm install
$npm run start

```

This autocompiles and runs the live server on localhost:8080
