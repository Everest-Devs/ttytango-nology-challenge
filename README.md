# nology-challenge

## How to install

### Method 1
1)
- Clone repository onto your local device.

- Open the nology-challenge folder and then open up index.html file in your browser.

This method will load fastest, as it will ignore scss code, which has already been compiled in to css file, with the js script stored in the index.js file.

### Method 2

This method assumes you have node and npm installed on your device. It will allow you to view the sass/scss and make changes should you wish to play around with the styling.



1)
- Clone repository

- Then cd into nology-challenge directory

2)
Run the following commands:
```
$npm install
$npm run start

```

This autocompiles and runs the live server on localhost:8080
